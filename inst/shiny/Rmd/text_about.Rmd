### **What is *shinyscholar*?**  

<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" style="width: 150px; float:right; padding:10px;"/>

Welcome to *shinyscholar* a template for creating applications that are modular, meet academic standards of attribution and are reproducible outside of the application. By using *shinyscholar*, to create a template application, developers will be encouraged to produce applications that are maintainable and run reliably without having to learn software development best-practices from scratch. *shinyscholar* was <a href="https://github.com/wallaceEcoMod/wallace/tree/51a3ebe10ffd797fc36ad2d2cf8245b014d11b41" target="_blank">forked</a> from `{wallace}` v2.0.5 (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=wallace" target="_blank">CRAN</a>, <a href="https://wallaceecomod.github.io/wallace/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>) a modular platform for reproducible modelling of species distributions (Kass et. al 2018; Kass et al. 2022). Specifically, it harnesses the higher-level structure and core attributes of Wallace but removes its discipline-specific features, yielding a generic template for developers to make their own applications. 

*Shinyscholar* contains four components (Select, Plot, Reproduce, Template) each of which contain one to three modules (`select_query`, `select_async`, `select_user`, `plot_hist`, `plot_scatter`, `rep_markdown`, `rep_renv`, `rep_refPackages` and `template_create`). Each of the modules in the Select and Plot components calls a function with the same name. The `select_query` module and underlying function is the most complex, containing various elements for handling errors, both in the module and in the function. The `select_async` module has the same functionality as `select_query` but the module runs in the background and the rest of the app remains usable. The other modules are very simple but included to demonstrate how multiple components and modules can be used. The Reproduce component is used to generate an rmarkdown document that reproduces the analysis conducted in the application, download a list of packages that the application uses and download citations to those packages. The Template component can be used to produce and download a template version of an app with the same features.

### **Attributes of _shinyscholar_**

Many of these attributes derive from `{wallace}`, but others are new to *shinyscholar* as described in <a href="https://github.com/simon-smart88/shinyscholar/blob/master/NEWS.md" target="_blank">NEWS</a>. Apps built using *shinyscholar* should maintain these attributes:

* **accessible**: lowers barriers to implementing complex modular `{shiny}` apps for scientific analysis by providing an intuitive graphical user interface
* **open**: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0) and can be viewed from inside the application
* **expandable**: users can author and contribute modules that enable new methodological options
* **flexible**: options for user uploads and downloads of results
* **interactive**: includes an embedded zoomable `{leaflet}` map, sortable `{DF}` data tables, and visualizations of results
* **instructive**: features guidance text that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each step in the workflow
* **reproducible**: users can download an `{rmarkdown}` .Rmd file that when run reproduces the analysis, and also save sessions and load them later
* **reliable**: modules and their underlying functions are tested using `{testthat}` and `{shinytest2}`
