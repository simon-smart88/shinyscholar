#' @title \emph{shinyscholar}: A modular platform for creating reproducible applications
#' @description \emph{shinyscholar} is a template for creating reproducible \code{shiny}
#'   applications to academic standards. shinyscholar is forked from 'wallace'
#'   and provides a template for producing applications that are interactive,
#'   reproducible, adaptable and built to high standards. It was created to ease
#'   the process of creating complex workflows in a single, streamlined GUI interface.
#'   In addition, executable session code  (R Markdown format) can be
#'   downloaded to share with others or use as supplementary information
#'   for scientific papers and reports. An example application is run via the
#'   function \code{\link{run_shinyscholar}} and requires
#'   \code{install.packages("shinyscholar", dependencies = TRUE)}.
